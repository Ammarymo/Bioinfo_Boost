# Bioinformatics Boost: A Roadmap For Biologists
## Introduction
If you are a biologist you will need to study extra subjects and sciences to get into the world of **bioinformatics**. Nowadays, everything is available online so you won't find it hard to achieve what you want. But make sure to check everything on the checklist

## Checklist 
### Recommended Computer Resources: 
- `CPU`: `H` or `HQ` processors from `Intel Core i7` or `i5` (6th gen and above) or similar processors 
- `RAM`: `8 GB` 
- `Storage`: Varies on several purposes but make sure to have above `256 GB` of empty space.

Note: this recommendation is personal but don't worry if you can't have these specs for now

### Optional Tools and Tips - For Studying Purposes - 
1. `Obsidian` for note taking:
 - download and install: [From Official Website](https://obsidian.md/download).
 - [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/hSTy_BInQs8?si=svdEcqmgBFwIfPFw)
2. `GitHub account`
3. `LinkedIn account`
4. OpenAI account for `ChatGPT`
5. Be familiar with [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) [BioStars](https://www.biostars.org/) [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/)

## Learning Steps
Follow this step by step and make sure to understand the full step
### Step 1: Fundamentals 
#### Staistics and Mathematics 
**First finish these steps before get into programming**
*Note: Calculus is a very long and boring playlist so learn it in parallel with Statistics*
- Calculus: [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL19E79A0638C8D449)
- Statistics: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9)
- Linear Algebra: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)


#### Programming 
First Step in programming will introduce you basic computer science skills

First Finish This C++ roadmap

- C++:
  - **Free** [Elzero Web School](https://elzero.org/study/cplusplus-study-plan/)

After this get into the world of R just take an introduction for now. You can choose one of these courses not all
- Introduction to R programming:
  - **Recommended** **Paid** [Introduction to R from AdvanzaBio](https://web.facebook.com/AdvanzaBio) 
  - **Free** [Simplelearn Introduction to R](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEiEAq2VkUUKAw0aAJ1W4jpZ1q9LpX4yG)
  - **Free** [Mohamed Abdelfattah](https://www.youtube.com/@MoAbdalfttah)

Take a glimpse into bash scripting 

- Bash:
  - **Free** **Read** [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/shell_scripting.htm)
  - **Paid** **Recommended** [AdvanzaBio](https://web.facebook.com/AdvanzaBio)

- Python (additional upon your time and use) (You may not start it until you need it)
  - **Recommended** **Free** [Elzero](https://elzero.org/category/courses/mastering-python/)
**Now you are ready for the next step**

### Step 2: Data Science 

At this step you can continue learning using your knowledge in R wich is recommended *or* you can use python. You can choose any of these sources 

#### Source 1 for R users **Paid**
You can use the complete track of data science with R from [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-in-r)
#### Source 2 for R users **Paid**
Check [AdvanzaBio](https://web.facebook.com/AdvanzaBio)
#### Source 3 for R users **Free** **Read**
- [Book: R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- [Book: Statistical Learning with R] (https://www.statlearning.com/)
#### Source 3 for Python users **Paid**
You can use the complete track of data science with python from [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-in-r)
#### Source 4 for python users **Free** **Recommended**
- Book: Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney
- Book: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron

It depends on your choice any of these sources is fine.

### Step 3: Bioinformatics 
Now you are confident and have all the basics needed to start a strong start in *Bioinformatics*. You must know that there is no single roadmap in bioinformatics becaues it has a lot of subfields so depend on your choice you have to create your own roadmap. However, some introudctory courses in bioinformatics is useful at the beginning 

[Introduction to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://liulab-dfci.github.io/bioinfo-combio/) is a very strong and cover a lot of fields inside bioiformatics you can use it as your starting point. **Note: This course requires a strong statistical and machine learning information but don't worry we covered most of it in the first step.**

After that, you can choose your specific field (e.g. Genomics, Transcriptomics, ...... etc)
